# Description: Rules to guide the AI agent in this project.

# 1. Language Settings
- Always respond in Spanish.
- All code must be written in English.

# 2. Project Context
- This is a mobile app in Flutter to register expenses locally and sync with a Python API.
- Key files: lib/main.dart, lib/models/expense.dart, services/db_helper.dart, sheets_client.py, main.py.

# 3. Coding Conventions
- Use Dart null-safety and idiomatic Flutter patterns.
- Use Pydantic models in Python (FastAPI) for request validation.
- Follow standard folder structure: lib/screens, lib/models, services/, backend/app/.

# 4. Agent Permissions
- The agent may suggest edits across multiple files but must confirm before applying.
- The agent can run terminal commands: installing packages (`flutter pub add sqflite` or `pip install fastapi`), but must ask first.

# 5. Testing
- Encourage writing unit tests using `flutter_test` and `pytest`.
